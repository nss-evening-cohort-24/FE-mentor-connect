# Mentor Connect

Mentor Connect is a space where anyone seeking guidance in their professional career can connect with experienced mentors based on their varying areas of expertise by booking appointments.

## About the User
- The ideal user for this application is a young professional seeking mentorship in their career.

## Features

- The user will be welcomed to a landing page where they can learn about our organization.
- From here, the user can browse available mentors and book an appointment with them.
- Once an appointment is booked, the user is directed to their profile page which will display profile information, along with all appointments the user has booked. 
- From here, the user can also update or cancel (delete) their appointments if necessary.
